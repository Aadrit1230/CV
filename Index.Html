  <h1>Aadrit Sarkar</h1>
  <p><em>The most inquisitive child on Earth.</em></p>
  <p>I like to search for interesting facts about animals. My favorite land animal is the Siberian Tiger. I study in DPS Miyapur School in Hyderabad. Animals and wildlife are so fun to learn about. I also learn about the Universe, but wildlife is the
    majority.</p>
